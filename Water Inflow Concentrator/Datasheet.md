# Water Inflow Concentrator
A very simple tool that catches particulates in bodies of water for downstream processing. Using a commonly available and autoclavable foam flask stopper, a USB-powered submersible water pump, and a simple 3D printed collar, you can easily run up to 150 liters per hour and recover the insoluble material, microbial cells, and other debris for use in biological applications. Our use for such a device will be geared toward screening the East River in New York City for archaea, specifically halophiles and phototrophs but this can be used in many other scenarios where water particulate concentration is needed. Feel free to modify, fork, and enjoy!

### Build and Use

1. 3D-print the filter holder ideally using a high infill to ensure structure is watertight.
2. Cut a 25mm wide strip of parafilm that is one parafilm square tall.
3. Fold the strip in half length-wise.
4. Wrap the strip around the input port of the aquarium pump several times just below the widest part of the port. This will ensure the filter holder slides on snug and is water tight.
5. With a roatating motion, screw on the bottom of the 3D-printed filter holder while applying pressure such that the filter holder is tightly bound to the pump's input port. Ensure no wobbles and if loose, apply more parafilm and try again.
6. Autoclave a foam stopper along with 50mL of distilled water.
7. Once autoclaved, using aseptic technique, place the sterile filter sponge into a sterile 50mL conical tube containing 25mL of sterile distilled water. Cap the tube and store at room temp until needed.
7. When ready to use, surface sterilize the 3D-printed filter holder portion of the pump aparatus using a paper towel damp with isopropanol 70%.
8. Using a sterile tweezer or gloved hands wiped with isopropanol, place the pre-soaked sterile foam stopper into the filter housing in such a way that the filter is not compressed but does not stick out beyond the top of the filter holder.
9. Prime the pump by placing the now-assembled Water Inflow Concentrator into the body of water you wish to sample from. Allow to sit for 30 seconds so the foam saturates with sample water.
10. Turn on the pump by plugging the male USB end into the USB power bank. Allow to run for at least 10 seconds and ensure a bubble-free stream is coming out of the output port of the pump. No stream means there is an air pocket which will require an underwater resetting of the foam stopper. A bubbling stream means the foam is not fully saturated, if so please remove the filter using gloved hands while submerged and squeeze out any remaining air. Reapply the foam stopper and repeat steps 9 and 10.
11. Run the pump for a desired amount of time which should be empirically verified to ensure satisfactory amounts of particulates are collected. This will vary across sampling sites and water quality levels.
12. Using a gloved hand or sanitized tweezer, remove the foam stopper from the pump assembly and place it into a 50mL conical tube for later use. Ensure proper labeling of time, place, date, and if possible other metrics like pH and temperature which may be useful for later. Store foam plugs at 4Â° C for later use. Note any living microbes will die without food so plan experiments such that stopper is used within at least 48 hours if live cultures are required.
